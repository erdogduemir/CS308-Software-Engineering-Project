For this project we have constructed an e-commerce website. The main focus for this e-commerce website is cars. The site is complete with functionality such as sign-up, commenting, rating, etc. The site also has functionality for managers, managers can add items remove them, approve or disapprove comments, update the status of an order such as, pending, in-transit and delvered, etc. The only part of the website that isn't "real" is the payment part as it is not connected to any service, but it is still connected to backend so the system can proceed with the order.

We have constructed our database with Django. Therefore, virtual environment is a must to build that before migrating into a local database.

Moreover, we are uploading this project without its 'node_modules' folder, which can be easily constructed with 'npm i' in the frontend folder.
